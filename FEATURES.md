# Features

Thuldor's Skyrim is just that - a personalized load order I've developed for about one year, brought to you in an easy-to-install package. You'll find enhanced visuals, new quests, grander locations, and more rewarding gameplay, all integrated into a cohesive experience that remains faithful to the original game.

## Core Mechanics

Thuldor's Skyrim is built around the 'SimonRim' suite of gameplay overhaul mods. That includes mechanical changes to magic, perks, combat, alchemy, enchanting, and much more. By default, the game includes light survival elements, such as exhaustion, warmth, injuries, and limited fast travel. 

The list also makes heavy use of my own overhaul, [Sentinel](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/100985). If you're a fan of that mod, this is the definitive way to experience it - a wide variety of armors and weapons, all distributed around the world in a cohesive manner. 

## World

Thuldor's Skyrim transforms the province's landscape, making heavy use of overhauls like Northern Roads, Cities of the North, and The Great Cities. It also includes my very own Thuldor's Ivarstead, and a customized set of fortifications for Whiterun that haven't been released anywhere else.

It does all of this while making full use of SR Exterior Cities - bringing the full open cities experience to your overhauled landscape. Leap off the cliffs of Solitude, look out from the Great Porch of Dragonsreach, or slip past guards through Riften's canals, all **seamlessly and without load screens**.

## Visuals

With nearly half of its 1400+ modlist dedicated to graphical enhancements, Thuldor's Skyrim updates the game's original look for modern hardware. That means lush grasses and canopies, rugged weather, intricate architecture, realistic animations, and more. Near everything, from the largest mountains to the smallest crumbs of food, have been given a facelift that is both stunning and internally consistent. 

The list makes use of NAT III Weathers, the Lux lighting suite, Cabbage ENB, and several of the best NPC overhauls on the Nexus, like Project ja-Kha'jay, Children of the Hist, Children of the Paraiah, and High Poly True to Vanilla NPCs.

## Quests

This is a list meant to be played, not just looked at. Embark on a diverse selection of epic quests, including:
* Beyond Skyrim: Bruma
* Skyrim Extended Cut: Saints & Seducers
* Tales of Skyrim - Berserkyr
* Sirenroot - Deluge of Deceit
* Siege at Icemoth
* Wyrmstooth
* Khajiit Will Follow
* Val Serano
* and many more...

Thuldor's Skyrim enhances existing quests using expansions by creators like JaySerpa and TheOscar0, while also integrating Creation Club content more seamlessly into the original game's experience. There are too many to to list here, but full documentation is available on the modlist.
